## Processing Steps
Turnout statistics at the block-level were aggregated to the precinct-level by assigning each block to the precinct with which the majority of its area overlaps with. This was performed using the maup package's assign function.

Two block with registered voters were not given assignments, these were analyzed by hand and assigned to the closest precinct, which in both cases was clear.

## Additional Notes
The fields in this file correspond to those voters registered to vote at their residence as of the date mentioned above. 
The vote history fields are tied to individual voters, then aggregated up - not tied to blocks as a whole, and as such represent whether or not voters in the block as of the L2 voter file date above voted *anywhere*, not necessarily specifically in that block. 
As such, this information can be used to approximate how the demographic in the block voted historically, but cannot be used to track how individuals in that block voted at the time of previous elections. For snapshots from previous voter files, please reference previous voter files hosted by the RDH. 

The RDH cannot certify the accuracy of any of the information contained within this file.

* RDH is providing aggregates of the top 8 parties in the state. 
** For the narrow ethnicity categories, RDH is providing an aggregate of all ethnicities that have more than 
1000 individuals state-wide. L2 ethnicity categories use modeling techniques to infer an individual's ethnicity.

Additional voter file processing information and fields can be found in the block-level L2 voter file, linked above.
